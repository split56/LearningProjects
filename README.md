Goals : Learning python and git at the same time 

Project 1 : Passwords manager: <br> 			
-, just a fun beginning project (i got intrigued by the concept of cryptography). <br>
-, i mainly practice basic git commands with this one. <br>
-, add -> commit -> push. <br>

Project 2 : Slot machine: <br> 			
-, fun project when having to handle some edge cases dealing with array. <br>
-, i mainly practice basic git commands with this one. <br>

Project 3 : Turtles race: <br> 			
-, a small medium project. <br>
-, i need to level up the difficulty in these projects. <br>
-, i keep getting into trouble when trying to push! <br>

Project 4 : WPM: <br> 			
-, a another small project before the advance ones. <br>
-, i keep getting into trouble when trying to push! Guess the only way to fix this is to try until it works <br>
